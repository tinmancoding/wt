# Task: Missing Lint Configuration

## Priority: Critical ðŸš¨

## Problem
The project is missing ESLint configuration, causing the `bun run lint` command to fail with "Script not found". This blocks the quality gates defined in AGENTS.md and prevents code style enforcement.

## Current State
- `package.json` has ESLint dependencies installed
- No "lint" script defined in package.json scripts section
- No ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc.js or eslint.config.js)
- Quality gates in AGENTS.md reference `bun run lint` but it fails

## Impact
- Cannot enforce code style consistency
- Quality gates fail, blocking phase progression
- Development workflow broken for linting checks
- CI/CD pipeline would fail if implemented

## Solution
1. Add "lint" script to package.json
2. Create ESLint configuration file
3. Update AGENTS.md to reflect working lint command
4. Ensure all existing code passes linting rules
5. Update documentation (README.md) to include linting instructions

## Files Affected
- package.json
- New: .eslintrc.js or eslint.config.js
- AGENTS.md (verification)
- README.md (linting instructions)
